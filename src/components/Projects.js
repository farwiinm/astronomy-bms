                  <p>Astronomy is the study of everything in the universe beyond Earthâ€™s atmosphere. That includes objects we can see with our naked eyes, like the Sun , the Moon , the planets, and the stars . It also includes objects we can only see with telescopes or other instruments, like faraway galaxies and tiny particles. And it even includes questions about things we can't see at all, like dark matter and dark energy.</p>

These patterns are called constellations, and they have been used for centuries as a way to navigate and understand the sky. Each constellation has a story or myth behind it that has been passed down through generations. We'll take a closer look at some of the most well-known constellations and learn about them.</p>

                        <p>Imagine you're standing in a dark room with a single lightbulb. If you move closer to the lightbulb, it will appear brighter to you, and if you move farther away, it will appear dimmer. This same principle applies to stars in the night sky. The closer a star is to Earth, the brighter it appears, and the farther away it is, the dimmer it appears.</p>
